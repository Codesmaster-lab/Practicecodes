## Practice Statement - Sort words

**An engineering college has created a mandate for all students to mark their attendance on a daily basis. The exercise would help them check whether their students are regularly attending their classes or not. The names of all the students have to be stored in alphabetical order for simplifying the process of marking attendance.**
**Write a Java program that sorts and displays all the names given in the list in alphabetical order.**

**Sample Input**

    words[] = {"Rahul", "Ajay", "Gaurav", "Riya" }

**Expected Output**

    The sorted words are::
                            Ajay , Gaurav , Rahul , Riya

## Practice Statement: WeightedÂ Average Score

**Performance of students of an engineering college is evaluated based on marks obtained by them in assessments that are carried out throughout the year. The percentage value assigned for each of the different types of assessments conducted is listed below.** 


|Sl No|Assesment Type|Percentage|
|---|---|---|
|1|Assignments|10%|
|2|Projects|35%|

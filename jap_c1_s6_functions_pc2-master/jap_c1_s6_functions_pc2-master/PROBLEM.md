## Practice Statement: Hourly Wage Calculator

**A steel manufacturing plant needs to calculate straight wages and overtime pay for all its hourly employees. Overtime is considered any additional hours worked above 40 hours. â€‹

The standard hourly pay rate is $12. Overtime pay is double; or $24.**

For example, 
- if an employee works for 45 hours in a week , he gets 5 hours of double pay
- The standard amount paid to all daily wage employees is $12 per hour.
- Please note that the manufacturing plant does not allow an employee to work for more than 60 hours in a week.

**Write a Java program that takes the fixed pay for an hour and total number of hours worked as input, and calculates the wage of a worker depending on the number of hours worked and prints the total pay.**


|Name of Employee |  Base Pay | Hours Worked|
|------|-----|-----|
|Jane| $7.50 |35|
|Sarah|$8.20 | 47|
|Harry | $12.00 |73|
|Sammy  |$15.50 |35|
|Tom   |$18.20|47|
|Dave  | $12.00|73|
